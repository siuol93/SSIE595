# SSIE595
SSIE 595 Termination Project
This repository is used to store the code files as well as excel datasheets containing the actual data for the memes exported from Google Trends.
It also includes screenshots of results from running the code: SSIE595-MemeProject-FINAL.py and SSIE595-MemeProject.py

..

SSIE595-MemeProject-FINAL.py will produce an excel file by the name memerun0.0.csv with the data of variables a,b,c,d,e tested with different numbers.

SSIE595-MemeProject.py will produce a figure when run in SpyderV3.0 that should show the datapoints from a list of inputted values for variables a,b,c,d,e.
